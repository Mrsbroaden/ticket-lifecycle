Above, I am creating a new ticket as an end-user in the end-user portal. In my example, The end-user did not necessarily pick what kind of problem they were having in the "Help Topic" section, but did give a summary of their problem. This will give the agent a better idea of the end-user's issue.

Above, I logged out as an end-user, and logged in as my project Help Desk agent "John". John is going to observe the ticket properties. Upon opening the ticket, we see that it has a few default settings, such as default SLA, and its not yet assigned to an agent for example. In this portion, I am going to pretend that John is the performing the service desk portion to set the correct properties, and then route it to the appropriate department.

I set the SLA to Sev-A which means it needs to be addressed within the hour because its crucial to the company's online business banking, and gave a brief description of why it was set to that level of severity.

  The Help Topic was changed to "Report a Problem/Business Critical Outage

Next, I am going to work the ticket as Agent "Jane" who is assigned to the "Online Banking" Department. Below, I have logged out of Agent "John's" account, and logged in as Jane. This is shown in the image below.

Once Jane could open up the ticket, as part of the Online Banking team, she was able to assign the ticket specially to herself. This is shown below. A brief update is given by Jane on her work of the ticket.
