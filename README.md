Above, I am creating a new ticket as an end-user. In my example, The end-user did not necessarily pick what kind of problem they were having in the "Help Topic" section, but did give a summary of their problem. This will give the agent a better idea of the end-user's issue.

Above, I logged out as an end-user, and logged in as my project Help Desk agent "John". John is going to observe the ticket properties. Upon opening the ticket, we see that it has a few default settings, such as default SLA, and its not yet assigned to an agent for example. In this portion, I am going to pretend that John is the performing the service desk portion to set the correct properties, and then route it to the appropriate department.

I set the SLA to Sev-A which means it needs to be addressed within the hour because its crucial to the company's online business banking, and gave a brief description of why it was set to that level of severity.

  The Help Topic was changed to "Report a Problem/Business Critical Outage
